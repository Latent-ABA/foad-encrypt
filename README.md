This code is an EU project in a parisian uni (France), so vars, functions and comments are in french. Some choices were dictated by requirements. 
This code take a sentence in MAJ (minimal length : 9) and key (minimal length 4 and max 1/2 length sentence) in MAJ (only 'A' to 'Z' char accepted) and encrypt it using Vigenère cipher style.
It saves, if path is correct, Sortie.txt file
It tries also to guess the key using only the sentence and encryption
For longer sentences, you can change the size of sentence and key givin in the code. 
Some choices were made to meet the project requirements,leaving it "less" optimal than it could be.
Enjoy (~￣³￣)~
